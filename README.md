# Haystack-GPT4All-Clone
This repo was created for educational purposes only. It contains the code to my first RAG pipeline using Haystack https://haystack.deepset.ai/. Eventually, I found out I recreated GPT4All (but worse performance).

There is also a frontend repository that fits to this backend code: https://github.com/jWinman91/Haystack-GPT4All-Clone-Frontend
